# Armstrong-Number
Number Theory Exercise

Number Theory : the Narcissist Number
in a given number base {b} is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

In Example:

Input:  371
Output: 371 is an Armstrong number  
Solution:  
 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371

Program solves for if user inputs given number is an Armstrong Number or Not.

An n-digit number that is the sum of the nth powers of its digits is called an n-Armstrong number. 

Examples : 
371 = 33 + 73 + 13; 
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44;
93084 = 95 + 35 + 05 + 85 + 45.

Write a Python program that; takes a positive integer number from the user, 
checks the entered number if it is Armstrong,
considers the negative, float and any entries other than numeric 
values then displays a warning or update status message to the user.
